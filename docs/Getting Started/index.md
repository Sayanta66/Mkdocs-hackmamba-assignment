# Introduction

## What is Protekt?

Protekt is a developer-first authentication platform that can help you integrate authentication methods, IAM, and Single Sign-On (SSO) to your application with limited overhead.

Protekt is useful primarily to:

- Implement authentication flows in minutes.
- Easy to navigate dashboard for managing users and roles through your admin (based on our foundation).
- Follows important and modern standards like **OAuth 2.0**, **OIDC**, and **SAML**.
- APIs and SDKs that make development and maintenance easy.

## Why should you use Protekt?

Authentication has become quite confusing for most developers. From dealing with tokens to integrating multiple types of authentication, it is a daunting portion of a developer's work. With Protekt, the complexity and challenge of authentication are lifted away by our developer SDKs and our ability to integrate into all of the tools you already use for the required authentication. With Protekt's simple, but comprehensive developer documentation and numerous integrations, developers can concentrate on the 'work' while we put the muscle behind it.

Some of the biggest reasons we are great for developers are:

- **Super-fast Integration**: Use our [Quickstart Guide](Quickstart.md) and you will have authentication set up and running in your application in minutes.
- **Flexible APIs**: Build your own authentication flows with our flexible [REST APIs](../Reference/API%20Reference/) and [SDKs](../Reference/SDK%20Reference/).
- **Trusted Security**: Trusted security by default with industry-standard encryption and compliance in practice.

## Start your Journey

To authenticate with Protekt, you first must access the Protekt dashboard by **signing up** for a free Protekt account at [protekt.dev](https://protekt.dev). If you want to learn more about the configuration of the dashboard, check out our [configuration guide](Configuration.md).
